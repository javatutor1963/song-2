I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life

I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free

I am not my mistakes
And God knows, I’ve made a few
I started to question the angels
And the answer they gave was you

I cannot promise there won't be sadness
I wish I could take it from you
But you'll find the courage to face the madness
And sing it because it's true

I love my life
I am not my mistakes
And God knows, I’ve made a few
I started to question the angels
And the answer they gave was you
